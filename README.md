## Data Sources
- **HR Dataset**: `hr_data.xlsx` containing employee information, salaries, leave balances, and education qualifications.

## Tools
- **Power BI**: For data cleaning, analysis, and dashboard creation.


## Exploratory Data Analysis
---
EDA involved exploring the sales data to answer key questions, such as:
- How many people are in each job?
-  Gender break-down of the staff
-   Age spread of the staff

## Steps
1. **Data Loading and Cleaning**: Import data into Power BI and clean using Power Query.
2. **Creating HR Metrics**: Calculate headcount, average leave balance, and average salary using Power Pivot.
3. **Adding Columns**: Add columns for employee's first name and age group.
4. **Analyzing Salary vs. Education**: Visualize the relationship between salary and education qualification.
5. **Using Visual Filters**: Filter to see top/bottom paid staff in each job.
6. **Customizing Visuals**: Change colors, axes, labels, and legends for better visuals.
7. **Advanced DAX Calculations**: Create cumulative headcount and identify leave balances > 20 days.
8. **Designing the Dashboard**: Create a monthly HR dashboard with key metrics.
9. **NEW Card Visual**: Use card visuals to highlight key figures.

## Results
The project provides insights into HR metrics, trends in employee data, and relationships between different variables, displayed in an interactive Power BI dashboard.
